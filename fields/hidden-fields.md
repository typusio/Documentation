# ðŸ‘» Hidden fields

Hidden fields are found under the General section of the Settings tab. They allow you to hide fields from being recorded by Typus. They are very useful for hiding fields that are used on your site to dynamically change the fields with JavaScript, but don't want them to be displayed on Typus.

To configure them, go to the General section of the Settings tab and enter the fields you want to be hidden, separated as commas. For example, if you enter `name, message` the `name` and `message` fields will be ignored by Typus.
