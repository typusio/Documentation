# âš¡ Connecting with Zapier

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) is an incredibly powerful platform that allows you to hook thousands of different services together. One of these services is one they created themselves called "Webhooks", which allows you to receive requests from external services \(in this case, Typus\) and gives you the ability to hook it up to any of their other services. This makes connecting Typus to other services extremely easy, some examples of the things you can do are:

* Every time a submission is created, create a card on a Trello board.
* Send a notification to your team on Slack whenever a new submission is made.
* ...and fun ones like turning your lights blue whenever you get a new submission!  **ðŸ˜œ**

Excited? So are we. Lets get started!

### Step 1: Setting up the Zap

First, sign up for a Zapier account and create a new Zap. Where it says "When this happens", search up "Webhooks". You should see something like this

Click "Webhooks by Zapier", and select the "Catch Hook" option.

Then, click the "Continue" button.

### Step 2: Setting up the Webhook

After you click submit, you should see something like this:

Copy and paste this URL into the "Webhooks" field on the Notifications tab of your form on Typus, and make sure to enable them. Your settings should look something like this:

Next, click the "Continue" button. 

**We strongly recommend** that you make a test submission to make sure everything is working, then click the "Test & Continue" button. It will help Zapier understand what we're giving it and it will help you later in the process.

### Step 3: Connecting it!

Now, the fun part! It's up to you what you want to connect it to. If you followed our recommendation at the end of the last step, Zapier should have very nice autocomplete based on the data it received.
